Setting Up Your Programming Assignment Environment
======================================================

The Machine Learning course includes several programming assignments which you’ll need to finish to complete the 
course. The assignments require the Octave or MATLAB scientific computing languages.

  - Octave is a free, open-source application available for many platforms. It has a text interface and an 
  experimental graphical one.
  
  - MATLAB is proprietary software, but a free trial license to MATLAB Online is being offered for the completion 
  of this course.
  
## FAQ
**Does it cost money?**

While you’re taking the course, both software packages are available free of charge. Octave is distributed under 
the GNU Public License, which means that it is always free to download and distribute. MATLAB Online licenses are 
available for completing the programming assignments in the course only. For any other purposes (like your own work after you complete the course), MATLAB can be licensed to individuals or companies from Mathworks directly.

**Is there a difference in quality?**

There are several subtle differences between the two software packages. MATLAB may offer a smoother experience 
(especially for Mac users), contains a larger number of functions, and can be more robust to failure. However, the 
functions used in this course are available in both packages, and many students have successfully completed the course 
using either.

**How do I install one of them?**
